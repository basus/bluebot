Bluebot is a simple template for writing HTML5 webpages. It provides a set of
CSS styles and web fonts along with some example HTML for writing clean,
decent-looking webpages. It's designed to be used for standalone pages,
i.e. single webpages that are complete in and of themselves.

I wrote Bluebot as an easy way to build single webpages without having to write
everything from scratch every time.

Though the template is mostly monochrome, there is a little bit of blue used for
the borders and the header, hence the blue. It also makes use of the Droid
family of fonts provided via Google Web Fonts, hence the bot.
