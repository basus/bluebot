      <h2>What is Bluebot?</h2>
      <p>
        Bluebot is a simple template for writing HTML5 webpages. It provides a
        set of CSS styles and web fonts along with some example HTML (this page)
        for writing clean, decent-looking webpages. It's designed to be used
        for <em>standalone</em> pages, i.e. single webpages that are complete in
        and of themselves. An example would be the webpage for a project that
        you are releasing on the web, just like this one. However, that's not to
        say that it couldn't be easily adapted to work with multiple pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote Bluebot for myself in September 2011 as an easy way to build
        single webpages without having to write everything from scratch every
        time. The look and feel is based on
        my <a href="http://basus.me">personal website</a>, but somewhat
        simplified. I use Bluebot for
        my <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~basus">Cornell University
        webpage</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why is it called Bluebot?</h2>
      <p>
        Though the template is mostly monochrome, there is a little bit of blue
        used for the borders and the header, hence the <em>blue</em>. It also
        makes use of the Droid family of fonts provided via Google Web Fonts,
        hence the <em>bot</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Where do I get Bluebot?</h2>
      <p>
        Bluebot is available on Github. Feel free to clone it and fork it for
        your own use. If you add code and styles that you think would be useful
        for others, send me a pull request and I'll try to incorporate it. Note
        that Bluebot includes
        the <a href="http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/">HTML5
        Reset styleheet</a> which is in the public domain.

      <h1>Examples</h1>
      <p>
        The rest of this page shows how different HTML5 elements look under
        Bluebot. For starters, every <code>section</code> element gets placed in
        it's own bordered section. <a href="#about">About</a> was
        a <code>section</code> and so is this one. While the examples are mostly
        self explanatory, looking at the HTML and CSS source might be useful.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h1>This is an H1</h1>
      <h2>Here's an H2</h2>
      <h3>There's also an H3</h3>

      <p>
        And of course there are normal paragraphs. You can <em>emphasize</em>
        things or make them <strong>strong</strong>. And you can make lists of things.
      </p>

      <p>These lists can be ordered</p>
      <ol>
        <li>This is the first ordered item</li>
        <li>and this is the second.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Or they can be unordered</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Like apples</li>
        <li>And Oranges</li>
      </ul>

        Quotations from famous people always look good. But you have to be
        careful to set them apart from the rest of the text and give due
        credit. Also Thomas Jefferson was <strong>not</strong> President of the
        United States.

        & like(any self-respecting template)
            {
                There is support for writing code
            }
        but for (more advanced requirements)
            {
                Use one of the JavaScript syntax highlighters
            }
      </pre>

      <p>
        There is also styling for the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> HTML
        tag. Just remember that you need to put in the <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>
        tags to break the address into lines yourself.

      <p>
        There might be support for tables in the future (if I find myself
        needing them). I'm also considering adding a style for two-column text
        sections. However that would require using some JavaScript and I'm
        undecided as to whether I want to include JavaScript with Bluebot.
